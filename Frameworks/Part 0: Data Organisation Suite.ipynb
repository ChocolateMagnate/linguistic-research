    "# Linguistic Data Organisation with Python\n",
    "One of the many various advantages why applied linguists and data scientists prefer Python alike is ita abundance of rich frameworks and libraries designed by numerous engineers and thoroughly tested. Some of them, in particular **Numpy**, **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** form a famous trio of data arrangement and visualisation, which far exceeds GUI-based applications such as Google Spreadsheets. In this notebook, you will learn about what Pythonic libraries draw the best data management practices in a simple and comprehensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NumPy\n",
    "The first and simplest one is the library used to process numeric data and advanced math operations. *NumPy* is a library that pairs simplicity and flexibility of Python with C-backed primitive lightweight numeric constraints and allows developers generate true arrays of integers or floating-point numbers the same way as in C. This package is primarily concerned with boosting performance with aid of homogenous arrays and performing mathematical operations on them.   \n",

    "## Array initialisation\n",
    "Making an array in NumPy is as easy as calling its `array()` method and passing a Pythonic list."

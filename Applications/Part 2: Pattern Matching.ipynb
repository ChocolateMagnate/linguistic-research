    "# Pattern Matching and Text Extraction\n",
    "When we deal with vast texts, it is essential to be able to find some explicit fragments that convey the information we need. This technique is useful in *question answering* where applied linguists can design systems that will be capable to answer questions by searching the information in the text. \n",
    "# Regular expressions\n",
    "## Static expressions\n",
    "The most primitive approach to fulfil this task is to search through the pattern of characters that are supposed to identify the piece of text one needs. It's highly specific and depends a lot on the choice of words, register and style of speech, but sometimes character matching is the easiest way to find what cannot be conveyed through grammatical relations easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The way how regular expressions work is by specifying a special pattern that can contain hard characters, loops, gaps, sets and intervals, and the special method will return all segments from the text that correspond to the pattern. When only words are used as a regular expression, they will yield of instances of said words encountered in the text."

    "\n",
    "## Dynamic expressions and quantifiers\n",
    "Regular expressions are much more powerful when used *dynamically*, that is with certain flexibility that other characters can embody. In regular expressions, developers can specify how many times some character must be repeated in the following fashion:\n",
    "* `+` matches pattern one or more times (making it obligatory);\n",
    "* `?` matches pattern one or zero times (making it optional);\n",
    "* `.` matches any character;\n",
    "* `{m, n}` matches pattern at least `m` times but not more than `n`.\n",

    "**Sets** is a way to tell that one of the characters from a set must follow. They can be as simple as specific characters and extend to nested regular expressions. Regular expressions also support a number of *character classes* to convey a group of characters more easily, such as ASCII, alphanumeric, digits, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the event if there is no available character class, it makes sense to create your own with **ranges**. Ranges essentially allow users to create custom sets that consist from all characters that lie in a range. For example, `[a-z]` is the range that includes all lowercase Latin symbols, while `[0-9]` encompasses all numbers. Ranges tend to be suffixed with a quantifier to express how many times a single character from a set of range must repeat. "
